# Stardust
AI for StarCraft: Brood War

## About
Stardust uses [BWEM](http://bwem.sourceforge.net/) for terrain analysis and a modified version of [FAP](https://github.com/N00byEdge/FAP) for combat simulation.

## License

The license is MIT with the added condition that forks may not be submitted to StarCraft AI competitions without written consent of the author.

The rationale behind this is to try to prevent minimally-altered forks from popping up in competitions, as has happened with my first bot, Locutus.
