# Locutus
AI for StarCraft: Brood War

## About
Locutus is a Protoss bot. From the initial release on SSCAIT in April 2018 to AIIDE 2018, Locutus was a fork of Steamhammer. It has since been rebuilt from the ground up, incorporating many of the concepts introduced while Locutus was a Steamhammer fork, but built on an entirely new foundation.

Locutus uses [BWEM](http://bwem.sourceforge.net/) for terrain analysis, [BWEB](https://github.com/Cmccrave/BWEB) for building placement, and [FAP](https://github.com/N00byEdge/FAP) for combat simulation.

## License

The license is MIT with the added condition that forks may not be submitted to StarCraft AI competitions without written consent of the author.

The rationale behind this is to try to prevent minimally-altered forks from popping up in competitions, as has happened in CIG and AIIDE 2018.

## Results

CIG 2018: 1st place
